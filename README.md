# Important lessons (often learned the hard way)

Properies are important if you want text to dynamically change via kivi script, but sometimes you can get away with self.x or something similar to this. Probably has to do with where you are in the inheritance tree.

kv scripts are helpfull

make sure that you name things correctly

android.txt file should have this in it
title: X
author: X
orientation: X

you could also use buildozer...
you might need buildozer to compile it into something to put on the Play Store...
 
 
probably need a mac to make an IOS compatable app.
